# React Weather App with Clothing Suggestions

This weather app was made by me and 3 others at university as part of a GUI design module. The weather app doesn't just tell you the weather, it gives you helpful suggestions for those conditions. The focus was more on the design and user experience, hence we focused on creating a stylish, easy to use and intuitive design.

To have a look at our work, please feel free to run it using the instructions below!

**Note:** The weather api used is a basic free one so the api key is already set. Unfortunately the Google places api had to be turned off. To be able to change location you will need a google places api set up. More guidance is [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details), however this is not essential to run the application, the functionality will just be limited (not being able to change location)
